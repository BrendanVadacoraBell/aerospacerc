# BVB's Aerospace configuration

Linux users have the amazing i3 window management/tiling tool for properly sizing, navigating and laying out their windows in specific workspaces. Mac has [Aerospace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace), and its fantastic. This repository persists the configuration/dotfile(s) for Aerospace.

## Changelog

### 2025-03-11
Remove deprecated option causing failed config load.

### 2024-05-25
Updated workspace-to-monitor mapping to avoid index based mapping that is only horizontal in favour of named mappings to account for the new vertical monitor setup.

### 2024-04-02
After using Aerospace for 1 month, its become a necessity in proper workflow and workspace management. This is the initial setup of workspace that supports vim motions for moving windows, switching windows, and the multi-monitor setup too.
